# Portfolio
Hi! Welcome to my personal portfolio. The website is still under progress in the projects section and finding methods to improve the about section. However, if you want to use the custom animations I built, your free to use it. It's my first time fiddling with animation so using it is a bit finniky but it works fine. 

I've ran into many problems during the course of this project, especially in the UX design. I tried to go for a dark theme cyberpunk feel while maintaining professionalism and simplicity in the webpage. The colors are inspired by that theme while the minimalist look kept it professional as this is a portfolio for employers.
